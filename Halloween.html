<p>Fortnite is a popular online game where you can fight against other people or against mobs. Currently there are two modes: Battle Royale and Save the World. On Battle Royale, there is Fortnitemares. Fortnitemares adds spooky titles and new things to the current gamemode. In the new cut scene, the island containing the mythical cube broke. Then, the cube made parts of it play all over the map and now cube zombies/monsters spawn there. Now, mobs and other players are the current danger. i didn't go anywhere this Halloween so I thought I would mention this as a substitute.</p>
